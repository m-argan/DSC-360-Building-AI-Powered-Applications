[2025-09-11T17:03:01][gemma3:1b] Hello! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

[2025-09-11T17:03:09][user] Good! I have a question for you

[2025-09-11T17:03:09][gemma3:1b] Okay, great! Iâ€™m ready. Whatâ€™s your question? ðŸ˜Š

[2025-09-11T17:03:14][user] What is 2 + 2?

[2025-09-11T17:03:15][gemma3:1b] Okay, 2 + 2 equals 4. ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?

[2025-09-11T17:03:40][gemma3:1b] Okay, letâ€™s do that! 2 + 2 equals 4. Adding 2 to that equals 6. ðŸ˜Š
