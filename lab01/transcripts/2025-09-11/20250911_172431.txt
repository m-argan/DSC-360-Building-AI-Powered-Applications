[2025-09-11T17:24:38][gemma3:1b] Okay, thatâ€™s a simple addition! 2 + 2 equals 4. 

Is there anything else I can help you with?

[2025-09-11T17:24:45][user] can you subtract 2 from the last sum?

[2025-09-11T17:24:46][gemma3:1b] Okay, letâ€™s do that! The last sum was 4. Subtracting 2 from 4 gives us 2. 

So, the new sum is 2.

[2025-09-11T17:25:01][user] /model <gemma3:4b> Can you add 2 to the last sum?

[2025-09-11T17:25:07][gemma3:4b] Okay, let's do it! The last sum we were working with was 2. Adding 2 to that gives us 4. 

So, the new sum is 4.

[2025-09-11T17:25:27][user] /new can you add 5 to the last sum?

[2025-09-11T17:25:29][gemma3:4b] Okay, you want me to add 5 to the last sum. 

To clarify, what was the last sum we were working with? Please remind me! ðŸ˜Š

[2025-09-11T17:25:46][user] The last sum was 4!

[2025-09-11T17:25:50][gemma3:4b] Okay, so the last sum was 4! Letâ€™s add 5 to that... 4 + 5 = 9! ðŸ˜Š 

Is that correct, or were we doing something else entirely?

[2025-09-11T17:25:58][user] yes, that is correct

[2025-09-11T17:26:01][gemma3:4b] Fantastic! ðŸ˜Š I'm glad we got to 9. Is there anything else youâ€™d like to add or calculate today?

[2025-09-11T17:26:15][user] no, goodbye /exit

[2025-09-11T17:26:16][gemma3:4b] Okay, goodbye to you too! ðŸ˜Š Have a wonderful day!
