Part 1 — Structured Extraction

This script converts unstructured course text (e.g., “CSC 170 Programming and
Problem Solving 4 a T. Allen 1:50–3:50PM -M-W-F- OLIN 208”) into structured,
validated rows using a Pydantic model defined in schema.py.

In Part 1, your task is to:

- Write code in `extract_structured_record()` that uses your local LLM
  (through Ollama) to extract structured data following the schema.

- Pass SectionRow.model_json_schema() as the `format` argument when calling
  the model so it returns a valid JSON object.

- Parse the model output, validate it with SectionRow(**data), and return
  the resulting object.

For now, the provided stub runs end-to-end with a placeholder that returns
blank fields. This allows you to test the pipeline and see how the validation
and scoring work before adding your model logic.
